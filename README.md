## How to Run the Programs

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Terminal/Command prompt access

### Compilation and Execution
1. **Single File Programs:**
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   java ProgramName
   ```

2. **Multi-Class Programs:**
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java MainClassName
   ```

3. **Assignment Folders:**
   ```bash
   cd assignment/
   javac *.java
   java UserInterface
   ```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Run the calculator
javac Calculator.java
java Calculator

# Run the banking system
cd assignment/
javac *.java
java UserInterface

# Run the library management system
cd assignment2/1/
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Sample Programs Output

### Calculator Example
```
Enter the value 1: 10
Enter the value 2: 5
Enter the operator: +
Result: 15
```

### Banking System Example
```
Welcome to the Banking Application!
1. Create a new account
2. Deposit money
3. Withdraw money
4. View account details
5. Update contact details

- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding and dynamic method dispatch
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and methods
- **Constructors**: Default and parameterized constructors

### üî∏ Data Structures
- Arrays and ArrayList operations
- HashMap for key-value storage
- Collection iteration and manipulation

### üî∏ Design Patterns and Best Practices
- Proper class design and separation of concerns
- User interface separation from business logic
- Input validation and error handling
- Code documentation and commenting

## How to Run the Programs

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Terminal/Command prompt access

### Compilation and Execution
1. **Single File Programs:**
   ```bash
   javac ProgramName.java
   java ProgramName
   ```

2. **Multi-Class Programs:**
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java MainClassName
   ```

3. **Assignment Folders:**
   ```bash
   cd assignment/
   javac *.java
   java UserInterface
   ```

### Example Usage
```bash
# Run the calculator
javac Calculator.java
java Calculator

# Run the banking system
cd assignment/
javac *.java
java UserInterface

# Run the library management system
cd assignment2/1/
javac *.java
java Main
```

## Learning Outcomes

Through these exercises, I have practiced and demonstrated:

- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
- **Code Organization**: Structuring code for readability and maintainability
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive console-based applications
- **Error Handling**: Implementing proper input validation and error management
- **Documentation**: Writing clear, comprehensive documentation

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java (JDK 8+)
- **IDE/Editor**: VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Documentation**: Markdown

## Future Enhancements
- Add GUI interfaces using Swing or JavaFX
- Implement file I/O operations for data persistence
- Add unit testing with JUnit
- Integrate database connectivity with JDBC
- Implement more advanced design patterns
